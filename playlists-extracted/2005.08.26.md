nice club, the promoters bring in their own sound (and sub) and that helps immensely. super friendly bartender. lackluster crowd. the highlight was the occasional rain showers that were visible slanting downwards against the streetlight through the window behind the dj booth. I'm guessing that the water scared away the stragglers who were hanging out at the tables outside when we arrived. oh no, the highlight was actually when the guy came in in just his knickers, soaked head to toe from the rain, and just as he got to the bar chris' breakbeat breakdown hit, the dude raises his arms to the sky (ceiling?) and yells "Moral Kombat."  

stayed with Destro on this trip. super cool dude, very nice time. notably this was probably chris & my first breakfast with soy milk. quite nice. it should also be noted that this was the first date on the mini-tour we scheduled with Acceleradeck, who cancelled at the 11th hour (late the same afternoon) due to unforeseen circumstances.
