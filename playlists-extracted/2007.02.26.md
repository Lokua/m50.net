the key is eating before I come out, then I \*start\* out with energy. I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and grilled green pepper. perfect. for some reason the dani siciliano pitched up in leave me now reminds me of anh. I also realized after this trip that it isn't music that makes me down on music, it's life that makes me down on life. whenever I'm up on life, I'm up on music. should be obvious, I suppose.
