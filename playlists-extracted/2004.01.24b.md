Fundraiser for student production of Vagina Monologues 2004.Jan.25su 00:30 some ridge apartment, Evanston  
no set  

This ill-fated event was busted (probably for noise violations) within 10 minutes of my arrival. Lights in uncovered windows, lack of soundproofing, and at the time of the shutdown, multiple wide open windows pointed at the street probably didn't help. I did not DJ.  

interestingly, dj.nickd.org lists this as one of the best organized events ever.
