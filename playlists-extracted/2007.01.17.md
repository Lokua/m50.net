thanks to gina for fixing my bag, to inhashi for making it out for the latter part of my set, to grifty for the nice opening set and for sticking around, to nbfc & antiphase for having me out, to sassmouth, antiphase et al for hanging around till the end of my set, to hugo moya for the nice set and for hanging around till the end, and to ravi & lauer for coming out earlier on. it was a bit disappointing, as nights go, but I had a good enough time and felt pretty happy with my set anyhow.
