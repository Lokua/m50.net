Morgan Geist & Darshan Jesrani...thanks to aki, mike corsa, plastique and mike, karl and matt and vlad and yeongsun, jen, ian, julian, matt donovan (who was a bit of a distraction during the set), rocky jones, sadie woods (dancin'!) and all the radio winners who came out. great vibe throughout the night & lots of different types of folks out. thanks also to morgan & darshan, who were both in good spirits, wonderful to their legions of fans, and excellent on the decks. next time I have to remember to bring his remixes of CiM and Phil Ranelin. I also played something off the middle record in alcachofa in there somewhere, not sure where.
