thanks to ana miskovic, tanya & guram, gera & yulia, sveta, keter darker, sarah kim, ashina, nicole davis, cpkay, arturo, dj jazzy L, doug & saren, joel chandler, karl meier, brian patty, jay caston, marc & quantazelle, chris roberts, chris brown, lord gorn, christo haserot, constance, murph, teri, derek specs, christine navarro & artur. after the initial technical hiccups (all sorted in soundcheck, thankfully) it was quite a memorable night of wax and cats. highlights included the topless and remarkably endowed black lady swinging her shirt over her head enthusiastically during zach's set, dueling fist-pumping action from gorn & chrisroberts (the latter apparently trying to reach into the speak horns to extract the sound), specatcular visualizations from Lokua, and an enthusiastic crowd from beginning to end. well, at the beginning they were more attentive than enthusiastic, but we did last closing...
