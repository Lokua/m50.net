Graham B. Lippsmith...  
no setlist  

Some errors in the recording, I'm not sure why. unfortunately I lost my power adapter at Monday's gig, so maybe that has something to do with it? I hope my MD player isn't crapping out. Really slamming evening of music, though - great sets all around :\]  
I'm very excited to see where this new format takes us: Continuum played a set of some of the darker and more acidy house & progressive I've heard from him, Testosterone played sultry electro-house and grinding industrial, and Graham B Lippsmith (with his first performance under the new moniker) laid out the smoothest set of tribal techno I've heard in a long time.
