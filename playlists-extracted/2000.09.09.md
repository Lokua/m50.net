Another budding label out of Chicago, Thousand has 5 releases out now with more on the way. The Knots release shows how some of today's electronic artists re-process one of prog rock's 'giants.' The remixers include such fine acts as: legion of green men, kid606, phthalocyanine, lexaunculpt, and thermal (featured in past radioaktivities shows). The Orbitronik release provides a satire of rave & techno, a bit of musical whimsey on a genre that seems to have outgrown it's own oversized trousers. o.s.t. lays out sacred mayhem with the Death Notice release from qlipothic & phthalo.
