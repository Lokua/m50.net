on the way off the train a guy asks me if I'm lost; I say no, I'm fine thanks. I'm in a bit of a hurry since I stayed late at work and I don't want to be late for wabi. he says look, I ain't a bad brother but... and I cut him off and say look, I don't have any money. he says aw man, I was just going to ask you which way to... forget it. you know what, forget it. I haven't got a penny on me and I have 75c on my transit card. it costs me 2$ to get home. bugger off. welcome to america, eh? no recording of this evening's set. that was a rather boring set, actually.
