This was kind of the beginning of the set that I had planned to play, as I thought I'd be spinning more later on in the evening. Ironically, several of the tracks I had lined up actually ended up being played later on anyhow (Ark v Akufen, Prince). Overall, other than that, it was a fairly successful evening for all involved so I'm glad that everything went off smoothly. All the DJs had stellar sets as well.
