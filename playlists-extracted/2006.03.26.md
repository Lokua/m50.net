My Were They...  
no setlist  

yeah, I didn't end up getting to play at this one as My Were They occupied the entirety of the evening, but Geneva came out (kind of funny, since she still hasn't seen me spin yet) and it looks like this will be my last show at Rodan, again. but not the last time I played I guess ;\]
