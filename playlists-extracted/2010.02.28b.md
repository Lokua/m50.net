"I was STOKED to get this snack-pack of bass from my newfound friend and purveyor of deepness, DJ M50. Hailing from Chicago by way of Canada, this producer has snuck up on the scene with some badass dj sets and a release (under the Area alias) on Francois K’s Wave imprint. M50 has been making a name lately with sounds that cross the boundaries of house, tech, dub and idm. On the DJ Circuit he’s made moves by playing alongside many of the greats: Speedy J, Ellen Allien, Apparat, Swayzak, Miles Maeda, Quarion, Hauke Freer, Superpitcher, Herbert, Suburban Knight, Andrea Parker, & Common Factor.. (phew!) Check this mix he dropped for Sounds Defy Gravity.. make sure to lower the lights, pack the bong and crank the bass.." - Mike Nouveau
