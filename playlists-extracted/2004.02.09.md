DJ Warp...  
no setlist  

Good sets all around. Kind of a weird evening for turnout, had a packed house up until about 45 minutes before closing (and certainly through no fault of DJ Warp's unsurprisingly excellent set). Everyone had fun anyway. About the stream: somehow the recording of Proswell's set very sadly mysteriously vanished. So only the DJ sets are available. Enjoy (and if you want to check out Proswell live, click back to the previous etc show where he puts his material through the paces)
