thanks to scott / boy for hairy for messaging, and for calls from xenon (I think? chicagostargazer), and terri; the phone didn't work for most of this show, not sure why - so not many calls and the giveaway didn't work out. i also think the stream was down for most of the night. sadly, the recording for this episode was lost due to faulty minidisc! terrible :/
