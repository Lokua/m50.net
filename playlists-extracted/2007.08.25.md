EDMX...  
live  

overall a passably successful show. on the bright side edmx got to play about a half a live set and really light things up, the djs all had good sets, hopefully the recording turned out. on the bad side, alexander got a citation & court date for a noise complaint, I lost a lot of money, and i let a guy leading a bunch of exchange students get my goat because he stole a bunch of our beer and then tried to start a fight with me about it. thanks to sergey, proswell & julia & ian and crew, emily & gabby & crew, spencer, deniz for stopping by, mark from hardboiled & girlfriend, ana & nancy & milena, and protman. thanks to everyone who played (galina on visuals) of course. thanks to franzen for providing the mixer.
