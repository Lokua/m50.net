Milieu "Hibernal Regions"...  
live  

Patch notes: Behringer Solina String-Ensemble, playing generative sequences in the major pentatonic scale via Keystep Pro, with delays and reverbs via Strymon Magneto/Starlab.  

This was my second session with a new toy, Behringer's recreation of ARP's Solina String-Ensemble synth from 1974, with generative sequencing from my Keystep Pro and filtering/FX proc from my modular system. It's very relaxing in a sorta Discreet Music way, to my ears.
