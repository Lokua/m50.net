no setlist  
a bunch of notes for this evening are due I think. first off, during the very first set, I play Streamlining forwards, then backwards, then forwards again as Arctic Hospital was setting up on the other turntable. I was pretty happy with all of the sets played by everyone for the night. the crowd arrived early and left at a reasonable time I guess, but there was a diehard contingent that started sometime around 1 and kept the dancefloor going till we went home. it got to be a real sweatbox in there, which was a nice change. sweat on the walls ;\] but not really sweat on the walls, more like just sweat on the people, and on the records. I had a lot of fun with my last set and a definite bright spot was that on top of the active dancefloor, I could also tell that Doug was getting into it (and \*almost\* dancing); the biggest highlight for the evening was Yard's closing set, which was one of the most personally moving sets I've ever heard - he opened with Recloose, worked into UR's Transition, and played Rktic towards the end. During this whole part Tamas & Sarah, Nick, Aki & Gina, Hiro, and I were just losing it.
