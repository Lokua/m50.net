2007.09.27th 21:00 CST (4hours, [Stone Lotus Lounge & Liquor Spa](http://www.stonelotuslounge.com/), Two Story House Party)

ended up not playing at this because the venue decided not to open the second floor on the night of the show, citing the claim that it would cut into their liquor sales. Traxxy, Ohm, DJ Operator, Miwa, and Sangre played on the night. thanks to oleg & ana & crew, and to emily and crew for coming out and supporting my non-existant set.
