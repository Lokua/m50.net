no setlist  

This was a very fun and worthwhile gig, although the turnout was certainly pretty unspectacular, especially as compared with the Geoff White, Speedy J and Ulrich Schnauss shows earlier in the week. Still, the heads were out, including [Meiotic](http://www.meioticpromotions.com/) Marc & Matt, [Proswell](http://proswell.inpuj.net/), [Consumers Research and Development label](http://www.consumerslabel.net/), [Merck](http://www.m3rck.net/) & a certain unnamable accomplis, [SubK](http://www.subk.net/), [Atomly](http://www.atomly.com/), [Oly](http://www.oly.cc/), Schmuude & Suz (who definitely win the prize for best dancing in both the couples and singles categories), Aki (thanks for the T-shirt!!) & Aki (thanks for the magazines!).
