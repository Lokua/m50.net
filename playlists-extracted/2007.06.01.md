ok so that show was a total bust. no monitors. recording on request, because I'm not going to waste server space with recordings of my playing these albums straight through. the lights in the studio are so bright they give me a headache and I can't turn them off because one of the sportscasters is editing a highlights reel in the main studio while I'm on. thanks to my mum and dad for calling during the show, and penny called and listened to some of the show as well.
