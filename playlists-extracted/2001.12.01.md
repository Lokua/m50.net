Fun set for aaron and me I think. He played just about the poppiest, funkiest set of west london, broken beat, disco mayhem ever to hit etc, and I played just about the most obscure and at times needlessly obnoxious set of drone pop-ambient noise glitch techno. Suffice to say, we were in our respective elements. Too many links above to list, check my artists and labels lists and just hit all the links there. As for aaron, try d6ga.com and prepare to have your mind blown for the price of a local phone call or your not-yet-bankrupt broadband provider's subscription rate, whichever applies.
