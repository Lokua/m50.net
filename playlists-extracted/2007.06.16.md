this seemed more like novelty to most of the folks in attendance than actually an interesting part of the show, but thanks to aki and gina for inviting me to play and to mike from bridge for coming out. not sure what I should write down for the timing, I played off and on from about 20:00-23:30, but the planned set was from 22:30-00:00
