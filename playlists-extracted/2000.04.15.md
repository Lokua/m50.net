"The Digilogic Error Demonstration"  
For this show, pieces made predominantly from audio feedback will be mixed into the set. Using both analogue and digital feedback source material, this 1-hour collage forms an automatic composition of sorts, as disparate tones and layered glitches gradually coalesce into novel textures. Other source material used will be the sounds of failing electronic equipment, phantom DSP, din disintegration, and granular acoustics.
