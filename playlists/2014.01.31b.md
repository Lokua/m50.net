thanks to moppy for inviting me, to molly k & dr spazz & gera & tanya & guram, milosh, tracy fox, arturo, amy, to the cute girl with the scissors - I don't know if she was making fun of me or what but I'm awkward like that, to jamie 3:26 for saying hello, to sev + cos for being so supportive, to ashina for being a TROOPER in the snow with me, to kim koch, to kera & her friend, and to everyone else who supported. kera said that she saw in this evening the turntables / records as an instrument, which was an interesting insight.
