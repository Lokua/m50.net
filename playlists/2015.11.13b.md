amazing trip! we went to the park, to normal brunch & a bookstore, to a big crazy brunch with a live band and a dog fight and biscuits, to my namesake bar with the best bartender ever, saw a demonic horse, went to a ten & tracer & offthesky jam. show was at a new space that was a concrete bass room that dean found & james ran and I learned that a highball is a whiskey ginger. usually. thanks to alex & audrey for hosting me, bocaj for connecting it & dean for the space & performing, daishi for connecting it & visual aesthetics & yam for playing, lauren for being an incredible trooper & ryan for driving us from the show, max for hooking up the ride home in his spirited away hat, ed & kelsey for breakfast & hospitality, marissa and james for partying :)
