Dandy Jack & The Junction SM...  
live  

really fun night, lots of positive feedback on the set, decent setup, big sound. first time I'd been to the loft in wrigleyville / boy's town, cool spot. probably the funniest part was this girl who was infatuated with ana and then later infatuated with svetlana. had a nice time chatting with martin & sonja, and in attendance were noah & val, slowerson, chicago.caroline, that girl with the "world's best taste in music" ex-streetbeat, talib, and lots of heads and party people. we went until the cops broke it up... daft punk is playing at my house.
