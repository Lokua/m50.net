Paul Kalkbrenner...  
live  

thanks to eric & ashina & murph & steve & saren & doug, dr spazz & molly k, guram, tracy fox, kelly gorz, soren & anna, joel chandler, mindy sherman, margo, all for coming out; nice to see karl, merrick, serafini, garrett, and lenny downstairs afterwards too. thanks to sergei for his persistent disappointment in my sets. it was a pretty fun night, and an unusual time playing on a big stage, couldn't really see much of the crowd to gauge response but I had lots of friendly feedback from people coming up to me afterwards, with several inquiring as to what style I was playing. got to hang out with paul & crew a bit, quite a sizable operation (apparently 7 on the road) and they're off cross-country this week. nice early support from eric & crew and streetbeat & crew. partied a bit downstairs for queen! too, but it was a surprisingly quiet night with it being the first snow of the season I suppose.
