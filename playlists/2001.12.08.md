2001.Dec.08 00:30 (270 minutes, [WNUR](http://www.wnur.org/), etc)3 Degrees vs [illmeasures](http://www.illmeasures.com/)...  
No playlists from this evening. Setlist was DJ Evol playing drum n bass, Justin Reed playing Minimal Techno, Stax playing house, Justin Reed playing house, and DJ Shaka23 playing house and closing with a track by Morgan Geist. These, in case you didn't notice, are all [illmeasures](http://www.illmeasures.com) DJs as 3 Degrees failed to show for the event. An unpredicatable outcome, as predicted. Cygnus, Don and Fen called.
