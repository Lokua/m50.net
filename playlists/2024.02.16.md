i was a little worried after this set (& before the set, tbh), after some travel mishaps thanks to a visit from zelensky. room & sound were very cool, was just worried because didn't get to talk to anyone right afterwards. but a beardy guy up at the art gallery said that he had had a fun time dancing, & then back in the basement met gregor (weimar?), with whom I had a longer conversation, with great insights / impressions on the trance / breaks sound in germany at the moment & how it its urgency is a very different kind of movement from the welcoming / easy-to-move to grooves we had this night (as I reflect on this, maybe had something to do with the 120-130bpm range vs the 140-150?) at least, that's how I understood it... so that was very encouraging. apparently metaboman was there & I entirely missed him >.< the sound tech was super helpful & friendly, huge hospitality from hannes for me & pdr & all the visual artists for the joint gallery show. ferdinand complimented me on my dancing & I hadn't even realized I did! (he's also an amazing cook.) a nice introduction to jena, met yang here too, i think from weimar as well. lots of unreleased pdr in the mix :D
