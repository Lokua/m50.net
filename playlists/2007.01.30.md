31 Avas...  
no setlist  

that was super fun! 31 Avas talked up the Matt Dear show she's doing on Friday, and we talked briefly towards the end about the show we're doing together at Ground Kontrol and about my show at Pi-Rem on Friday as well... Sr. Frio & SFS in tow, and the Dj before had really blonde hair, Romo? and we talked about the "full romo experience." we had all met up before this at the XV club for some booze where I didn't tip the waitress. So I will probably get poisoned there someday in the future...
