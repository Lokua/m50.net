wow, that night went really well and much much better than I expected. thanks to alexander & protman for having oleg and me out to play. thanks to ana and her cousin and malena and their friends, to lila and her friends, to diz and his girl, to stax and his friend, to coyote dg, to arun (who came in all the way from Detroit) and his friends all for coming out. I was happy enough with my set, got some people dancing, and the place was relatively packed for most of my set. I just realized that this was the most full I've ever seen betty's. funfun.
