SUMMARY  
We welcome a guy who's been a huge lift to us in radio and just a model of eclectic consistency, m50, the curator of etc radio & owner of Kimochi Sound of Chicago. A great playlist tonight for hour 2 and always an interesting guy to chat with.  

SHOW NOTES  
As broadcast October 9, 2020. We welcomed a very special guest to the show tonight in m50 of Kimchi Sound & etc radio. Max has been doing his thing for many years now with his etc radio weekly 4 hour show, and has been running his boutique label Kimochi Sound wherever he is on the map, be it Chicago or Germany. An excellent guy to talk music with and someone who always has a few stylistic surprises in store, this set being no different.
