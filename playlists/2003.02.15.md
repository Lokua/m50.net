\>>2003.Feb.15 00:30 CST (210minutes, [WNUR](http://www.wnur.org/), etc)  
Guest sets this week from [Plastique](http://home.uchicago.edu/%7Eecoslor) and Joshua Werner. Keeping with the recent tradition, no playlists were kept by the guest djs (bah) but some cool sounds were laid down. Plastique started out the set with house very much in the uptempo disco vein and graduating to tech-house or slow minimal house or whatever you want to call it later on in the set. There was some tag team from about quarter after 2 until josh arrived, at which point he blessed the audience with an opener from 100% pure circa 1994 and then continued to rock the melodic mimimal techno and almost idm. Too short but good.
