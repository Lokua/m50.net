huge thanks to chip norton fortune for being an amazing host, thanks to cpkay for coming out(!) and to the nice dj from aachen & his girlfriend, the guy from gabe's iowa city(!) and all the other supportive dancers. odd suprise with there not being any turntables but lots of new music to be heard in any case.
