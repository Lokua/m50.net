[Proem](http://www.proemland.com/) (Live PA - [Merck](http://www.m3rck.net/), Hydrant, [n5md](http:/www.n5md.com/), Monotonik, Component, [Toytronic](http://www.toytronic.com/), [Neo Oujia](http://www.neoouija.co.uk), [Carpark](http://www.carparkrecords.com/), Aural Industries), Reverend Robert Sinewave (DJ set), Atropa (Live PA) & Touchmaster Infinity (of String Theory - DJ Set - Lumptronic, SKAM) - [Consumer's Research and Development](http://www.consumerslabel.net/) label showcase  
(yes, this will be as ridiculously cool as it sounds)  

mailer version:  
Proem  
very prolific artist and accomplished live performer  
having released material on at least the following labels:  
http://www.m3rck.net/ http://www.mono211.com/ http://www.toytronic.com/ http://www.neoouija.co.uk http://www.aural-industries.com.au/ http://www.carparkrecords.com/ http://www.componentrecords.com/ and Hydrant recordings  
he has a very signature compositional and remixing style and a well-honed and fluid live improvisation  
this performance is unfortunately not 100% certain, but if he makes it to the studio it will certainly be a treat for all  
in any case, check him out at http://www.proemland.com/ or at the Glitch On The River event this weekend  

Atropa  
not really sure what to say about this one, a newer player on the IDM... "scene"  
has worked with String Theory, performed alongside acts like K-Rad and Cex, and remixed Salvo Beta  
has comrades not only at Consumer'sLabel but also over at http://www.someoddpilotrecords.com/ and http://www.sixgunlover.com/  
this will be a live performance and so surprises may well take place  
expect friendly little clicks, melodies, and tones  
something like minimal but not overly so  
in advance or retrospect, he's available at http://www.automaticbutt.com/atropa/  

Reverend Robert Sinewave  
dj set from the mastermind behind Chicago's own elite IDM / hip-hop / techno / ambient label http://www.consumerslabel.com/  
alright, he's not going to like that categorization, so let's just say that they're a young label  
with a rapidly growing reputation for attention to detail and a roster of well-respected and diverse artists,  
so far:  
crl001 del rey-speak it not aloud lp  
crl002 string theory's anhedonia cd  
crl003 atropa-shimo and hono 001 ep  
crl004 single minded pros-session 2 12"  
crl005 alder and elius-double entendre 10"  
expect this set to reflect the eclectic influences that are shaping the sound that sets these projects apart  
oh, and for the careful reader,  
one string-theory CD and one double-entendre (fresh off the press) 10" are available for free  
upon reply (one item per recipient please)  
one time offer only... but stay tuned to the live broadcast for perhaps more goodies  

Touchmaster Infinity  
one half of the team they call String Theory  
who as a pair have released recently on http://www.lumpen.com/ and http://www.skam.co.uk/  
as well as their sweet, brief album on http://www.consumerslabel.com/  
this is a wild man-beast when he meets the wheels of steel  
so prepare to be aurally assaulted by the galactic funk the Touchmaster provides  

touchmaster version:  
It is I, Touchmaster Infinity, emailing you to tell you about the Consumer's Research and Development showcase tonight on M:50's radio show on WNUR 89.3 in Chicago tonight at 12:30. The show will feature live on-air performances by Atropa and special guest Proem as well as DJ sets from Touchmaster Infinity (String Theory \* 0.5) and Reverend Bob Sinewave (CR+DL Headmaster).  

If you are lucky and there are a few unspoken-for minutes in the broadcast maybe I will be permitted by the Noble M:50 to plug in my laptop and play a few new jams of the String Theory variety and of the Touchmaster variety. You'll love it, I promise.
