thanks to mirei and riri for dancing up a storm! what a good trip and good night. the drive in tokyo from narita was breathtaking, and it was so touching that the guys said that my gramaphone mix + the view was their dream of the beginning of a movie, I suppose about life in tokyo. we had some ramen, followed by a shower and a snafu with the car, and then went to party. great time at the show, m1a got his groove on, the fellow from lighthouse made it out for most of the night, nice vibe + good time.
