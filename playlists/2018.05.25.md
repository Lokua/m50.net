Dreamlogicc - Condolences for the brevity but I (...continue to ramble while the font progressively gets smaller in order to accommodate the increasingly lengthy track title and as the font decreases and the length increases it becomes apparent that the only thing that very well might stop the incessant words from rolling along would be some sort of word-field limitation in place but when there aren’t any limitations in place the title for this dreamlogicc production could theoretically go for as long as the moon is the moon which seems like it would be quite a long time, at the very least it would be long enough for the author to have long-since dissolved in to a fine dust, likely along side every other living and dead thing on earth, you dig?
