Living Sundays 2009.05.03su 22:00 4hours @ [Rodan](http://www.rodan.ws/), Chicago  

my set on this evening was cancelled as my car was broken into immediately proceeding the show, and the music for this set was stolen. slava, lokua, slow children & garo played on the night, and it was nice to see kendra and morgan and ana out.
