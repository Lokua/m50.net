"Our man m50 is heavily involved in the Chicago techno/house scenes as you can tell from the impressive collection of flyers featuring his name on them on his site (m50.net). He also does a radio show on Chicagoâ€™s WNUR which you can find archives of here (anal0g.org). His production and remix talents have seen light on labels like Mathematics, soundshift, and more under the alias Area (discogs.com). We are pleased to bring you his mix of deep house and techno." - Tom Cox, Infinitestatemachine.com
