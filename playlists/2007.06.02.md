a really fun set, and as jeekoos said, this was like a reunion of sorts. the entire pts crew was there, plus two hula hoop dancers, kat\_zyie's new boyfriend, chamberweed, aaron, and of course the dogs. I got kicked off by the dubstep people for not being dubstep enough, but that's just how life is lately. great sets all around
