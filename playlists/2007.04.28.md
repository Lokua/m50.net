thanks to stacy peterson of course for having me out to CAD beforehand, then to her sister & sister's husband for coming out and being incredibly patient with the whole thing, thanks to oleg for the invitation and persistence and integrity, thanks to anna, thanks to jaret for coming through (sorry for chasing you off!), thanks to jeekoos for stopping by, thanks to bitstream@plexeme for coming out, thanks to matt for getting down, thanks to aki and gina (!!), and I think that's it. I was pretty happy with this set, there was no recording so I may have to revisit some of this soon.
