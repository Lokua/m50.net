Big props go out to Cedric of Spectrum of Sound & Music Q101 & Soundbar for setting up this event, in conjunction with DJ Xanax, thanks to her also. Mad props to DJ Skinny and crew who came out to support and shake they thangs. Thank you to Kershon and Steve Tang who came out to show love. I think that's it. It was a pretty darn fun night in the predictably swanky yet not overly upscale Minx Nightclub. A "Chicago" atmosphere was had by all, if any such thing exists, and I think that everyone was at least fairly happy with their performances.
