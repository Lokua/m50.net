thanks to emulsion and slava his friend (steve?) and terri and her friend and onefiftyone for coming out. this set was not recorded. bad on them for not paying either. otherwise, was pretty happy with my set; I accompanied the last 10 minutes or so of chungking express and the majority of 2046. setlist order is approximate.
