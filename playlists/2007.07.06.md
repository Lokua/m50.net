well attended, big night that was pretty fun too. it was nice to have a good crowd going for much of the set, although it waxed and waned sporadically as more people drifted into the club from the wrigley field Police show outside. lenny managed the night. thanks to oleg & ana, aki & gina, tesia & stacy, franzen, maria, kim & colin, thom goerner, peter lee & sara for coming out and supporting. thanks to the girl I sat down beside on the bench who danced all night, thanks to the parking attendant who gave me his last spot for 20$ when everyone else was charging 50, and thanks to the cool kids posse: droopy, eliot lipp, atomly and hernan who made it down later on.
