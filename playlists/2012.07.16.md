after initially mistaking [K&V](http://keytarsandviolins.blogspot.com/) for another bootleg blog, I found that they're actually thoughtfully just providing abbreviated reviews and sound samples with links to legit sources, so to pay tribute (and apologize for my oversight) I've submitted an exclusive mix set for their site. to further add confusion, the file is named for the record date, not the post date, and does not include any of my info on it, so have fun with that...
