moment of truth on the way, yummy lemonade, nice afternoon. too bloody hot outside, though - hope it rains soon. hi to jeekoos and blamstrain online. also exciting this afternoon was losing about 6 months worth of outgoing e-mail and then figuring out how to (mostly) recover it. unneccessary stress. the afternoon ended a little early due to it being kind of a quiet event.
