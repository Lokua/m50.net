this party was top-notch. thanks to justin / drmlgcc & slava for hosting the space, thanks to big toe productions / ben & ravi for co-hosting the artist + for the extra refreshments, thanks to everyone who came down, especially fritze & sergei, oleg & ana, chris & yungsun. thanks of course to quarion for the characteristically polished set and great attitude & patience. he remarked that this was the best set + party of his american tour (last date too, incidentally), slava remarked that if you could place the peak couple hours of the party on loop, it would be heaven, that it was perfect. oleg remarked that he was thankful for the party as he hadn't danced like that in months and months, and many others remarked that they hadn't danced + seen dancing like that in years. noli played a great set, and the live pas starting out the night were quality + interesting too.  

what a difference a week makes!
