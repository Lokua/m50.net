Heavy, mellow set chris put down this evening. Ambient at times, such a smooth vibe was crafted that one could find themselves lost in the synth wash and distorted backround of thundering bass. Check his site (was at http://ww1.math.luc.edu/~njurcin/wrom.htm) for this show out too, as well as the radioactivites (was at http://www.barbrigroup.com/chris, now at [http://www.phonaut.com/](http://www.phonaut.com/) ) page.
