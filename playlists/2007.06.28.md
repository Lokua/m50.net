the fact that I programmed Respons (100 BPM Special) during the sound check is perhaps an amusing footnote for this gig, while Repsons I penned earlier the same day. it was somehow inspired by anja schneider's loop de mer (check the c2ish offset bassline.) was definitely fun that a dance party broke out during each of my last 2 sets. thanks to let's go outside for having me down, to derek & cyn for coming through for part of the night, to lgo again for indroducing (or trying to) to tiranie, thanks to steve from buried in time and brian / gasp for coming down, to james anthony for bringing a posse as always, and getting down till the end.
