      <p>it always starts the same: you become a part of life.</p>
      <p>
        you have no idea of what was there before or what you were doing, and
        yet, that&#39;s it, you can now sense that you are within something
        moving, breathing, heart pumping. something that sings, that speaks,
        that whispers and screams, all at the same time. an ocean of noise and
        forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        you might not like that noise, but you&#39;re inside it now, and even,
        you are making noise too. and just like that, the ocean got a little bit
        louder. again.
      </p>
      <p>
        this thing called life.<br />from the void, you start to be. from the
        void, you&#39;re dropped in the middle of the playground, with no
        warning or asking. let the fun begin, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        and yet, here it is, already: your first ­ and what first! ­
        subscription. . with this thing subscribed you to, a whole universe has
        open its doors for you: the fantastic world of subscriptions. a lifetime
        of offers and wonders, choices and decisions. a place where everything
        is possible ... as long as you subscribe.
      </p>
      <p>
        from now on, and until life&#39;s dusk, you will be offered a thousand
        of roads and paths to enlight this thing they say is your existence. it
        won&#39;t last forever though, and don&#39;t even start to think there
        will be enough for everyone. hurry, humble customer, subscribe,
        subscribe, there is so much to gain! and it won&#39;t be for much: all
        they want is your time, will, thoughts and energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        what would you like in return? there&#39;s all you need: light, love,
        mo- ney, jobs, freedom, beer, friendship, juice, smiles, laughs, and
        tears, knowledge and speed; tv for dogs, dogs for humans and humans for
        tv, jazz music, techno music, house music, rock music, music, music,
        music, there&#39;s dicks, there&#39;s cunts, assholes, youth, wisdom,
        sardines, chocolate, mysteries and certitudes. 42. yellow leaves and red
        curtains. some relief then, no more pain. you&#39;re damn right life is
        great. life is rich, and full of mysteries yet to discover.
      </p>
      <p>
        you have the right to believe that the spoon does not exist. that the
        cake is a lie.<br />after all, you did felt these breaches of light when
        you took the red pill. when you felt love, or whatever that was, that
        time, that time or that time. when you encountered art, no matter its
        form, that time, that time or that time. and you do remember very well
        when you heard that timeless loop in the zukunft morning for the first
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        and you started to wonder if you should not have had more from the
        sunset.
      </p>
      <p>
        as charles b. would say, you could unlearn the teachings of the church,
        state and educational system. you could be here to drink beer. to kill
        war, and everything that stands in your way. get rid of the fear, and
        embrace the unknown. to laugh at the odds and live your life so well
        that death will tremble to take you.
      </p>
      <p>
        life is rich, and full of mysteries yet to discover.<br />see you,
        wanderer.

      <p>
        some things are heavy and some are not. why is it like this? style for
        instance seems to have no weight as long its timely and modern. gravity
        might change, but style endures. it&#39;s not how low you go, but where
        and when you show up. temporarily the peripheric mainstream may attract
        more likes then the contemporary self-contempt. gravity can be a bigger
        enemy then yourself. don&#39;t let gravity get you down!
      </p>
      <p>
        mix mup&#39;s new 12&quot; is fighting for a world where gravity is for
        everyone, regardless of rpm, bpm or bitrate. in this times mix mup and
        mikrodisko are standing as proud allies together. we shape magic carpets
        out of black gold! M12 vinyl slices will beat the terrestrial gravity!

        and inspired by the teachings of Jomboz Dushanbiev. Nikolai Fedorov
        thought the Pamir to be the cradle of humanity, the hidden and forgotten
        nest, a Pyramid of skulls that holded the secrets of past human kinship.
        He believed that most of Asian myths of human origin pointed the Pamir
        region as their inception. For the Chinese, Indian, and Semitic myths
        that that mountainous region of Central Asia, often referred to as
        &#39;the roof of the world&#39; was the key to understand and start his
        resurrection plan.

        A distant wind, with sounds of howling dogs and wolfs, wind becomes
        loud, sounds of birds in a distance confuse with wind, distant sounds of
        wolves, a distant radio sound is becoming clearer, a voice in Farsi is
        commenting and giving news, while a sound of working the land, earth
        working, sounds mix with the sounds of dance music pop music from the
        radio, we move inside and we hear a praying session, a funeral prayer,
        we hear the sound of a fire mill, and as we move to another space we
        hear a women singing a lullaby for a child, on a distance room we hear
        the voice of an old man speaking in Bartangi language, Sound of a Mill,
        becomes a music sound of low key and sustain drone sound, melancholic
        drone, with sound of room with a TV set on, the film The Bear is on, the
        old man voice comes back, while the film continues, Farsi voice in the
        film. And the sound of the mill returns, a loop and continues mill sound
        takes over.

        A water current is rhythmically flowing, while a chorus of female voices
        singing Dargillik, Lallaik, gets confused with electronic produced
        sounds, and interruptions or glitches like of digitally archived
        material, we hear a small river or water flowing, some voices appear,
        static sounds and a mechanical alarm sound becomes louder, like a
        mechanical beep, sound of daf or frame drum, a women voice start singing
        a lullaby, while we hear a rhythmic sound of cradle swinging, electronic
        sounds and static distortions become present, providing a confusion like
        a recording machinery, interfering with the voice, a rhythmic pattern of
        electronic beeps and clicks appear and sound of water flow returns,
        Become more intense, an artificial rhythm electronic pattern becomes
        accelerated and gets interrupted by water flow again, to close again in
        a crescendo of bursts, a zooming and bursting booming starts, music
        compose of glissandos like voices weathered from the past, a slow tempo
        melody of a distorted piano sound and the sound of rain in the
        background, and storm starts while the melody continues, the storm takes
        over.

        Carlos Casas about Nikolai Fedorov:<br />Fedorov thought the Pamir to be
        the cradle of humanity, the hidden and forgotten nest, a Pyramid of<br />skulls
        that holded the secrets of past human kinship, He believed that most of
        Asian myths of human origin pointed the Pamir region as their inception.
        For the Chinese, Indian, and Semitic myths that that mountainous region
        of Central Asia, often referred to as &#39;the roof of the world&#39;
        was the key to understand and start his resurrection plan, There he
        thought the cradle of the human race might have been located; he wanted
        to make a Russio-European expedition to excavate and discover the bones
        of these early men and by doing so not only provide a tangible proof of
        human kinship but also unite Russia and Europe. […]<br />For Fedorov
        Homo sapiens was a weak animal appalled by the forces of nature, and
        subjected to a senseless and endlessly recurring cycle of birth,
        procreation, death and disintegration. Yet God had endowed him with
        Reason and so it was, his duty to introduce some rational order into
        this irrational universe. He could and should further transform nature
        from &#39;a temporary enemy into an eternal friend&#39;. Unfortunately –
        and this was one of the major causes of human disunity – knowledge had
        become divorced from action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like Karl Marx, his coetaneous, Fedorov thought that the intelligentsia
        should change nature, expand it and transcend it, studying it was just a
        first step, to change it, he was disappointed and dissatisfied with
        their inability to propel change. However, he envisaged changes of far
        reach ideas from those propounded by Marx. Between his disciplines we
        can highlight Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky who visited Fedorov
        extensively at the Library at Rumyantsev Museum and whom went to become
        essential to understand men’s journey to space, and that will be the
        strain to understand Russian space program, and 1961 first journey into
        space by Yuri Gagarin.

        Fedorov was equally critical of both capitalism and socialism because
        both institutionalized the struggle for mere material possessions.
        Wealth and poverty were surely less important than life and death, and
        humanity&#39;s childish lust for &#39;toys&#39; was the sign of its
        mental and spiritual immaturity. The &#39;Intelligentsia&#39;, according
        to Fedorov, studied nature without giving any thought about how to
        change the world to become perfect, better. They studied causes without
        considering the ends. No higher purpose guided their often random
        scientific research. So whenever this intelligentsia acted and applied
        their knowledge, it was to promote industry which manufactured
        unnecessary consumer goods<br />(the possession of which merely
        increased the gap between the &#39;haves&#39; and the &#39;have
        knots&#39;); or, worse still, they applied their knowledge to devise
        abominable weapons which increased distrust and hatred between nations.
        Universities were nothing more than &#39;the backyards of factories and
        army barracks, that is, serving industrialism and militarism&#39;. To
        protect their wealth, the rich promulgated laws, set up courts of
        justice, established police forces and other unbrotherly institutions.
        As to the poor, they rationalized their envy, greed and frustration by
        turning to socialist theories and violent revolution overturning the
        power structures without changing men’s ability to change nature and the
        world. All Matter is the dust of ancestors, for Fedorov everything that
        ever lived was to be channeled and brought back to live anew.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever topic he wrote about, Fedorov brought in his main idea of the
        Common Task – how to achieve universal brotherhood, rationalize nature
        instead of merely exploiting y her bounties, overcome death, resurrect
        the ancestors and create a united humanity worthy of governing the
        universe. The obsessive emphasis on the duty of the sons to resurrect
        their forefathers can possibly be ascribed to his traumatic childhood
        experience of losing both his father and his grandfather at the age of
        four, and to a subconscious guilt complex for having failed to keep them
        alive through adequate love. However, there is also a theoretical reason
        for his emphasis on filial love; for although humans share with other<br />animals
        both sexual love and love for their offspring, only human adults remain
        tied by affection to their parents when they no longer need their
        protection in order to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Fedorov the Pamir was the center of the worlds unrecorded history,
        as the place where he envision the rebirth and where thought older men
        was buried. The Pamir were for Fedorov like a Pyramid of Skulls, a
        mountain of humanity sedimented one on top of the other, he forsake a
        vision of humanity where all people will be resurrected and all will be
        able to share the world, this idea of the common task, is probably one
        of most radical theories I have ever grasped, its incommensurable vision
        is so far reached, that is hard to understand, way beyond its spiritual,
        theological and technological interpretation, its full comprehension
        enters a new realm of humanism.
