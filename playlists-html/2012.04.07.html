        well, the good parts were: kone-r took good care of me: had a nice place
        to sleep, shower, picked up kaz&#39; crackers &amp; pita (wrong pita I
        guess, but worth a try), guided me through the labyrinthine tube system,
        and we all went out for a nice pizza dinner at a massive mall near the
        venue. ginglik is great: hidden underground in plain view; entrance
        through a traffic island; low ceiling; decently loud &amp; well-rounded
        sound, expertly monitored by EK50 from Insekto, Semtek and Langer and
        Kone-R&#39;s friend Justin all came through, as well as Stayhome&#39;s
        girlfriend and her brother and his girlfriend, so we had a nice little
        corner going. the night was marred by slight technical glitches: one
        channel of the record-output on the main mixer was dead, Langer spilled
        beer on the mixing desk so that didn&#39;t help, and when I started my
        set the Serato started acting up significantly, but for the most part
        Kone-R and EK50 were on top of things.<br />the crowd, on the other
        hand, was a total fiasco. alternatingly beligerent and petulant
        throughout the course of the night, early on I had a blonde guy come up
        and tell me to &quot;play faster, no-one is dancing&quot; and then
        gesture to the mostly-full dancefloor and moan woefully. later a drunk
        spanish guy asking for shakira, and then trying to climb up the front of
        the stage &amp; decks to explain to me that he really wanted me to play
        shakira, girls asking if I have any r&amp;b, one girl actually coming up
        to ask &quot;do you have any music you like&quot; at which point I got
        snappy and replied that I&#39;d come all the way from Chicago to play
        them shit music all night. another girl just asked if I was going to be
        playing music &quot;like this&quot; all night, and looked dejected at my
        reply, later a girl standing in the middle of the dancefloor was
        demanding r&amp;b in 1 minute, 2 minutes? 3 minutes? later pouting at me
        still from the same spot saying &quot;what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;
        even though there was a decent dancefloor most of the night, people
        would insist on standing in front of the stage, sometimes even taking
        time for SMSing there. towards the end of the night an indian girl came
        up, I turned way down the mains to give her a proper audience, and
        undaunted she asked if I had anything else, complaining that she was a
        captive listener, then trying to be concilliatory asking that I might at
        least have prodigy, and requesting to search through my records, looking
        shocked when I stopped her. frustratingly, all of this hubub threw me
        off my game, so while the mixes were fine, I don&#39;t feel like it was
        a particularly inspired show.<br />on the serindipitously bright side,
        kalli lent me his copy of round ireland with a fridge, i started it on
        takeoff and read the last words on landing back in berlin. it seemed
        fitting.
