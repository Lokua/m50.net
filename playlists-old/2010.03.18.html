    &quot;m50 is a young (we think) guy who we know nothing about, we came across 
    his music on SoundCloud and have been enthralled because not only does he 
    upload a number of tracks a day but they are all ridiculously good. How does 
    he do it, well we don&#8217;t know&#8230; and we couldn&#8217;t find out anything 
    really&#8230; he&#8217;s mysterious, really really mysterious. He&#8217;s 
    so mysterious that he wouldn&#8217;t tell us his name and his &#8216;press&#8217; 
    photo is the pic of the blue floor which has a doorway to his studio we think? 
    At least the secrecy is not for obnoxious reasons as we found him to be very 
    modest &#8211; when we asked about his music, if it was the result of 25 hour 
    days in the studio, he simply said &#8216;I wish I was creative and diligent 
    enough to produce all day long, I don&#8217;t spend as much time on it as 
    I would like to&#8217;, perhaps the abstruseness is born from the complex 
    mind of a true artist.</span></p>
  <p class="playsmall">Luckily for the world he&#8217;s not too secretive to release 
    his music or perform. He&#8217;s had a weekly radio show on WNUR since 1999 
    and released as Area on some of the greatest labels of our time i.e. Wave, 
    Steadfast, Echospace &amp; Mathematics. For his next gig he will be playing 
    with none other than Francois K at Cielo for his Deep Space residency&#8230; 
    that all reads like the bio of a well travelled artist yet we haven&#8217;t 
    seen him in any press or listed on any European line-ups&#8230; so who is 
    m50? A phenomenal musician and we think his music will prove just that.</p>
  <p class="playsmall">m50 will be in London for a Colony event at The Russian 
    Bar on 15 May 2010, playing alongside Al Tourettes.&quot;</p>
