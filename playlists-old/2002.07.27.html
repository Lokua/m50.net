    More comments + photo coming soon... this show required a bit of work!<br>
    First, time to mention everyone that came. Roughly in order of their arrival, 
    Mani "The (sub)urban Turban" Miglani (check promiscuity link at top for blurbs 
    and links on everyone) Keith and Brian arrived in the parking lot at the same 
    time as I got there, so we went in together. MacQueen was finishing up Clinically 
    Inclined for the week and gave me a great introduction as well as finishing 
    off with his signature Detroit Escalator Co. The next people, in some order, 
    to arrive were Mike &quot;DJ Skinny" Levitt, Matthew &quot;Craque&quot; Davis 
    Ross, Vladmir &quot;Audiophile&quot; Grocic, and the pHonaut. After that came 
    Charles Adler, Steven &quot;Monomer&quot; Tang, Lizzy & Sarah (some friends 
    from NU who came down for the birthday party side of things), "Evil" David 
    Kullgren & his friend whose name I still don't know, Tiffany & her friend 
    whose name I also blank on, also friends from NU who stopped by only for a 
    minute to wish happy birthday (thanks!!). Sarah and Lizzy brought cookies! 
    Straggling in later on were Mike Rock, the infamous Kovin and his friend Christy. 
    Mike Crotch and Kovin brought donuts and seemed to have a good time too, although 
    seeming also particularly affected by the music (or perhaps other things). 
    Somewhere in there Ben &quot;Mercedez Ben&quot; Goldberger and Brian Hammersley 
    also came in, and last arrival for the evening was Vina, who had warned me 
    earlier that she might not be able to make it but against all odds (and other 
    commitments) managed to be present. <br>
    <br>
    I kicked off the show and everyone there jumped on the mic and things were 
    underway. Steven Tang's address stood out as he made brief but truly moving 
    nod to the Chicago techno atmosphere in general. Early on, dexterous skills 
    and selections were shown by Mr Hammersley and Mr Tang, the former showing 
    some skill and funk in his native house flavour and the latter really setting 
    the tone for a the early set with his melodic stabs and minimal, laid back 
    vibe playing off of Brian's house beginnings. Shortly thereafter, Audiophile 
    brought the intensity up a notch with his old-school cuts, trainspotted by 
    all, and this set the stage for Mani to strike with the hard stuff before 
    Kullgren chilled out the vibe again with an amazing track by Paul Mac, a producer 
    who actually ended up being the clear favorite for the evening, played and 
    cited by several in attendance. From there, a stripped down minimal style 
    went into effect, with support from pHonaut, Mercedez Ben and then Marko Katic, 
    in what would sadly be his only entry this evening. Craque played an amazing 
    live collage of sound by manipulating his cut-up Gus-gus record and samples 
    (from vinyl!) of newscasts immediately following JFK's assassination, following 
    up with a Squarepusher track that dared the next DJ to top its manic intensity. 
    Vina, who had just recently arrived, opted to return to the minimal style 
    preceding Craque but stepped the intensity up a notch, and then watched it 
    escalate with the performers who followed her. Soon we were treated to a 'white 
    label' test pressing of Tang's upcoming EP on Emphasis recordings, and a little 
    later on a couple more unreleased stompers courtesy of Mani, Advent vs Broom 
    on Kombination Research and a cut on Intergale. In between there was even 
    a surprising hard techno interjection by WNUR's own DJ Skinny, normally a 
    more downtempo minded fellow. It didn't end up getting any less abrasive from 
    there, and the rest of the evening was dominated increasingly by pounding 
    grooves, occasionally digressing into melodic songs as well, showing most 
    prominently when the styles of Steve Tang and Charles Adler would compliment 
    in sequence. The crowd didn't really thin out much until it started to near 
    04:00, and the flow continued until the very last. Audiophile played some 
    real classic techno songs, notably in one set where he dropped DBX's filtered 
    anthem and then an almost Carl Craigesque rare shimmering WARP cut by Joey 
    Beltram. Vina kept up the intensity and seamless mixing for the entire evening 
    as well, garnering mentions from several others who were having their first 
    time watching her spin. Overall, everyone seemed fairly satisfied with the 
    atmosphere of creativity and interaction at the event and I was pleased especially 
    with the musical content along with the flow, which managed to remain constant 
    in spite of an arguably broader range and certainly more intricate lineup 
    than the last event. Thankfully, though, Craque, Audiophile, Mani, and DJ 
    Skinny were still present from last time and were able to carry over the ethic 
    to all of the new participants. <br>
    <br>
    Finally, at 5am Synctank arrived and relieved the three remaining: Audiophile, 
    Vina and myself. Then embarking on the most extensive cleanup after my show 
    ever, I finally completed that and drove home and to bed. Since then, the 
    audio and visual aspects as well as the technicals were posted, and finally 
    here on sunday I'm getting around to writing something on this evening. As 
    for the pre- and post-parties, the damage (as surveyed at cleanup): one possibly 
    blown speaker, one old style, one mike's hard iced tea, two amsted lights, 
    one guinness, 4 bud lights, one red stripe, one bacardi silver, one missing 
    earplug. Not bad, I guess. Oh, and I'm older.</SPAN></div>
