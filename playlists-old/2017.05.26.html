    GRAVITY<br>
    <br>
    some things are heavy and some are not. why is it like this? style for instance 
    seems to have no weight as long its timely and modern. gravity might change, 
    but style endures. it's not how low you go, but where and when you show up. 
    temporarily the peripheric mainstream may attract more likes then the contemporary 
    self-contempt. gravity can be a bigger enemy then yourself. don't let gravity 
    get you down!<br>

    mix mup's new 12&quot; is fighting for a world where gravity is for everyone, 
    regardless of rpm, bpm or bitrate. in this times mix mup and mikrodisko are 
    standing as proud allies together. we shape magic carpets out of black gold!

    GHOSTS FROM THE FUTURE AND SPIRITS FROM THE PAST COLLIDE IN THIS SCI FI FIELD<br>
    RECORDING EXPERIMENT.<br>
    <br>
    Inspired by the common task (Fedorov) and the people of Pamir in Tajikistan, 
    filmmaker and sound artist Carlos Casas deconstructs far away sights and sounds 
    to create a unique field recording experiment that equally worships past, 
    present and future traditions.<br>
    <br>
    Music and sounds recorded and mixed under the spell of Nikolai Fedorov and 
    inspired by the teachings of Jomboz Dushanbiev. Nikolai Fedorov thought the 
    Pamir to be the cradle of humanity, the hidden and forgotten nest, a Pyramid 
    of skulls that holded the secrets of past human kinship. He believed that 
    most of Asian myths of human origin pointed the Pamir region as their inception. 
    For the Chinese, Indian, and Semitic myths that that mountainous region of 
    Central Asia, often referred to as 'the roof of the world' was the key to 
    understand and start his resurrection plan.<br>
    <br>
    AVESTA<br>
    <br>
    A distant wind, with sounds of howling dogs and wolfs, wind becomes loud, 
    sounds of birds in a distance confuse with wind, distant sounds of wolves, 
    a distant radio sound is becoming clearer, a voice in Farsi is commenting 
    and giving news, while a sound of working the land, earth working, sounds 
    mix with the sounds of dance music pop music from the radio, we move inside 
    and we hear a praying session, a funeral prayer, we hear the sound of a fire 
    mill, and as we move to another space we hear a women singing a lullaby for 
    a child, on a distance room we hear the voice of an old man speaking in Bartangi 
    language, Sound of a Mill, becomes a music sound of low key and sustain drone 
    sound, melancholic drone, with sound of room with a TV set on, the film The 
    Bear is on, the old man voice comes back, while the film continues, Farsi 
    voice in the film. And the sound of the mill returns, a loop and continues 
    mill sound takes over.<br>
    <br>
    TRIUNE GOD<br>
    <br>
    A water current is rhythmically flowing, while a chorus of female voices singing 
    Dargillik, Lallaik, gets confused with electronic produced sounds, and interruptions 
    or glitches like of digitally archived material, we hear a small river or 
    water flowing, some voices appear, static sounds and a mechanical alarm sound 
    becomes louder, like a mechanical beep, sound of daf or frame drum, a women 
    voice start singing a lullaby, while we hear a rhythmic sound of cradle swinging, 
    electronic sounds and static distortions become present, providing a confusion 
    like a recording machinery, interfering with the voice, a rhythmic pattern 
    of electronic beeps and clicks appear and sound of water flow returns, Become 
    more intense, an artificial rhythm electronic pattern becomes accelerated 
    and gets interrupted by water flow again, to close again in a crescendo of 
    bursts, a zooming and bursting booming starts, music compose of glissandos 
    like voices weathered from the past, a slow tempo melody of a distorted piano 
    sound and the sound of rain in the background, and storm starts while the 
    melody continues, the storm takes over.<br>
    <br>
    Siponj Variations<br>
    <br>
    MADOH<br>
    <br>
    THE SOUND OF GHIJAK with the voice of Jonboz singing, a background sound flourishes 
    in the back, a classic repertoire, and bells arrive followed by a rubab played 
    simultaneously with a daf, a rappoh, followed by lalaik tanboh, nolai tanbur, 
    Maddoh intertwines with electronic interferences.<br>
    <br>
    Dargilik Variations<br>
    <br>
    Jonboz offers a rendition of dargillik classic. Thanks to Theodore Levin, 
    Fairouz Nishanova, Zulobi RIP, Hichigh and Siponj villages and its<br>
    inhabitants without whom this recordings and experience would have never existed.<br>
    <br>
    Special thanks to Saodat, the princess of Turkestan, for being there for me, 
    sharing and opening all these worlds.<br>

    Bartangi - Dirushani - Rushani family of Pamir languages, ancient branch of 
    eastern Indo European branch<br>
    <br>
    Carlos Casas about Nikolai Fedorov:<br>
    Fedorov thought the Pamir to be the cradle of humanity, the hidden and forgotten 
    nest, a Pyramid of<br>
    skulls that holded the secrets of past human kinship, He believed that most 
    of Asian myths of human origin pointed the Pamir region as their inception. 
    For the Chinese, Indian, and Semitic myths that that mountainous region of 
    Central Asia, often referred to as 'the roof of the world' was the key to 
    understand and start his resurrection plan, There he thought the cradle of 
    the human race might have been located; he wanted to make a Russio-European 
    expedition to excavate and discover the bones of these early men and by doing 
    so not only provide a tangible proof of human kinship but also unite Russia 
    and Europe. [&#8230;]<br>
    For Fedorov Homo sapiens was a weak animal appalled by the forces of nature, 
    and subjected to a senseless and endlessly recurring cycle of birth, procreation, 
    death and disintegration. Yet God had endowed him with Reason and so it was, 
    his duty to introduce some rational order into this irrational universe. He 
    could and should further transform nature from 'a temporary enemy into an 
    eternal friend'. Unfortunately &#8211; and this was one of the major causes 
    of human disunity &#8211; knowledge had become divorced from action.<br>
    <br>
    Like Karl Marx, his coetaneous, Fedorov thought that the intelligentsia should 
    change nature, expand it and transcend it, studying it was just a first step, 
    to change it, he was disappointed and dissatisfied with their inability to 
    propel change. However, he envisaged changes of far reach ideas from those 
    propounded by Marx. Between his disciplines we can highlight Konstantin Eduardovich 
    Tsiolkovsky who visited Fedorov extensively at the Library at Rumyantsev Museum 
    and whom went to become essential to understand men&#8217;s journey to space, 
    and that will be the strain to understand Russian space program, and 1961 
    first journey into space by Yuri Gagarin.<br>
    <br>
    Fedorov was equally critical of both capitalism and socialism because both 
    institutionalized the struggle for mere material possessions. Wealth and poverty 
    were surely less important than life and death, and humanity's childish lust 
    for 'toys' was the sign of its mental and spiritual immaturity. The 'Intelligentsia', 
    according to Fedorov, studied nature without giving any thought about how 
    to change the world to become perfect, better. They studied causes without 
    considering the ends. No higher purpose guided their often random scientific 
    research. So whenever this intelligentsia acted and applied their knowledge, 
    it was to promote industry which manufactured unnecessary consumer goods<br>
    (the possession of which merely increased the gap between the 'haves' and 
    the 'have knots'); or, worse still, they applied their knowledge to devise 
    abominable weapons which increased distrust and hatred between nations. Universities 
    were nothing more than 'the backyards of factories and army barracks, that 
    is, serving industrialism and militarism'. To protect their wealth, the rich 
    promulgated laws, set up courts of justice, established police forces and 
    other unbrotherly institutions. As to the poor, they rationalized their envy, 
    greed and frustration by turning to socialist theories and violent revolution 
    overturning the power structures without changing men&#8217;s ability to change 
    nature and the world. All Matter is the dust of ancestors, for Fedorov everything 
    that ever lived was to be channeled and brought back to live anew.<br>
    <br>
    Whatever topic he wrote about, Fedorov brought in his main idea of the Common 
    Task &#8211; how to achieve universal brotherhood, rationalize nature instead 
    of merely exploiting y her bounties, overcome death, resurrect the ancestors 
    and create a united humanity worthy of governing the universe. The obsessive 
    emphasis on the duty of the sons to resurrect their forefathers can possibly 
    be ascribed to his traumatic childhood experience of losing both his father 
    and his grandfather at the age of four, and to a subconscious guilt complex 
    for having failed to keep them alive through adequate love. However, there 
    is also a theoretical reason for his emphasis on filial love; for although 
    humans share with other<br>
    animals both sexual love and love for their offspring, only human adults remain 
    tied by affection to their parents when they no longer need their protection 
    in order to survive.<br>
    <br>
    For Fedorov the Pamir was the center of the worlds unrecorded history, as 
    the place where he envision the rebirth and where thought older men was buried. 
    The Pamir were for Fedorov like a Pyramid of Skulls, a mountain of humanity 
    sedimented one on top of the other, he forsake a vision of humanity where 
    all people will be resurrected and all will be able to share the world, this 
    idea of the common task, is probably one of most radical theories I have ever 
    grasped, its incommensurable vision is so far reached, that is hard to understand, 
    way beyond its spiritual, theological and technological interpretation, its 
    full comprehension enters a new realm of humanism.<br>
