  <div align="left"><span class="playsmall">I feel silly writing out all the order 
    of performers with no setlists here, so you'll just have to read my commentary 
    instead. The evening started off with my playing of a few house cuts, followed 
    by some interactive mixing between myself and Audiophile. After that was the 
    debut of Christina Sheradon on radio in general as well as WNUR! Mercedez 
    Ben followed that set up with some groovy minimalism and then we closed out 
    the set with a frantic tag team set between Audiophile, Ben and myself. We 
    put down (according to Xanax's count) 21 tracks in the last 15 minutes of 
    the set. Fun times at Ridgemont High. This was the day the Internet crashed 
    because of some hole in MySQL apparently, which nobody at the station was 
    privy to but it nonetheless affected the recording as I couldn't remote log 
    in. A section in the middle was lost but mostly the evening ran smootly. Joshua 
    Werner and Xanax were along for the night as well and got buckwild with the 
    Public Service Announcements. No joke.</span></div>
