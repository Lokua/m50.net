    Christophe from mfive.org (and unscene!! 2009) phoned, sounds like an interesting 
    project / group of projects. Also, a random guy wandered in to this show around 
    2:25. Nice enough it seemed, he was a music major who was coming home from 
    practicing guitar and heard the concert up in Annie May Swift but wandered 
    into the radio station part. He was amazed by the grandeur of it all. Amusing. 
    XXsmurf also phoned and Fen surprised me and came by for the end of the set. 
    A somewhat disappointing evening in that I wasn't able to cover nearly all 
    the material I'd intended. Oh well, hopefully it wasn't too ambitious an undertaking 
    for me to be able to finish soon.<br>
    <br>
    There were a couple things I couldn't fit in to the first segment of Academia, 
    so there's going to be a catch-up show next week.<br>
    <br>
    Academia:<br>
    <font color="#FF0033">Hour 1 - The Unreleases:<br>
    including: Sense, Elleinad, Craque, Phasmid, Epoq, Cell, Drencom, Ilkae, Tstewart<br>
    Some of the best stuff coming out in music these days isn't even hitting the 
    shelves. Threatening to get lost in the shuffle are some artists who are making 
    truly standout work that is only getting heard here and there on compilations 
    and so on. Here's to the brave pilgrims: <br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://sense.unif.com/" target="_blank">Sense</a> hails from .au 
    with releases out on Neo Ouija and Aural Industries. <br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.craque.net/" target="_blank">Craque</a> is from Chicago 
    and has established a reputation for organic, reactive live performances as 
    well as an EP out on Metatron.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.phasmid.net/" target="_blank">Phasmid</a> is another American 
    with a Plone meets 8-bit construction set sensibility of lo-fi playful resonance, 
    an EP out on Monotonik.<br>
    <br>
    Elleinad is a talented, wonderful musician from Toronto, Canada who has stepped 
    onto the field of IDM after significant forays into ambient and jungle.<br>
    <br>
    Epoq is an Australian music student with a forthcoming (very soon) full-length 
    release on Tim Koch's Surgery Recordings, as well as an assortment of compilation 
    tracks.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.machinedrum.net/" target="_blank">Tstewart</a> aka Machinedrum 
    aka Syndrone. <a href="http://m3rck.net/" target="_blank">Merck</a> label 
    stalwart and musical vortex, upcoming album under this moniker is sure to 
    turn even more heads than he already has.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://ilkae.tpolm.com/" target="_blank">Ilkae</a> is Vexion and 
    Dazee. Vexion is Vexion and Dazee is Trisome. Vexion is also working with 
    Proswell. Vexion is also Aaron. Ilkae is trans-atlantic.</font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#006699">Hour 2 - Crunch: Funckarma v <a href="http;//www.proemland.com/" target="_blank">Proem</a><br>
    Both performers who have been releasing music for a number of years now. Funckarma 
    has been put out on such labels as DUB &amp; Clone, Neo Ouija and Isophlux 
    with a characteristically hip-hop oriented twist on their .nl based interpretation 
    of crunchy techno, industrial, and braindance. They've been in more places 
    than you know and have been on every landmark compilation in the last couple 
    years (Neurokinetic, Men With Boxes, Annexe, Nummer Een, Nummer Drie, Raginakudo, 
    Ambient Soho, Starfish Pool meets v/a series, n5md compilation series). Proem, 
    meanwhile, has been cranking out releases stateside on <a href="http://n5md.com/" target="_blank">n5md</a>, 
    <a href="http://m3rck.net/" target="_blank">M3rck</a>, Hydrant, <a href="http://mono211.com/" target="_blank">Monotonik</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.toytronic.com/" target="_blank">Toytronic</a>, Carpark 
    and Component. Most impressive to me have been his abilities to translate 
    other people's music through his own filter of textural and melodic process 
    and his consistant ability to put together a truly cohesive live set on the 
    fly. He is what the new rapping-dancing-entertaining school of IDM complains 
    about when they scoff at pure musicianship, and they hate him because he does 
    it so well. Funckarma and Proem may be miles apart, but they'll both kick 
    your ass with their industrial-strength, inorganic, killer hybrid musicianship. 
    As for the connection? Well, look out for the Gridlock remix 12&quot; on Hymen 
    to see them in the same place at the same time.</font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#996600">Hour 3 - .be+.fr v .nl+.de:<br>
    .be: <br>
    <a href="http://www.u-cover.com/" target="_blank">U-Cover </a><br>
    A creative engine of a label, U-cover has supported acts from all over the 
    world, as well as creating and continuing the Starfish Pool meets... project 
    in which various artists exchange musical phrases in the form of locked-grooves 
    (endlessly repeating cycles in a vinyl recording). With very promising publications 
    still on the horizon, this will continue to be a label to watch for spanning 
    many genres of listening music. U-Cover Inc-US division has been established 
    for North American distribution.<br>
    <br>
    .fr:<br>
    <a href="http://www.bip-hop.com/" target="_blank">Bip-Hop<br>
    </a>Phillipe Petite's brainchild, this label now is home to two compilation 
    series' as well as a quality assortment of full-length albums. Often ranging 
    into abrasiveness and melancholy, this is another group of releases which 
    aren't afraid to push boundaries, some of its artists are established in the 
    craft of sound-installations. Check out the website for a taster of the interactive 
    vision that Bip-Hop continues to push as it ignores borders and unites ideas.<br>
    <br>
    .nl: <br>
    <a href="http://www.eatthisrecords.com/" target="_blank">Eat-This</a><br>
    Growing in leaps and bounds, Eat-this has just launched Jip Recordings with 
    a debut release (and requisite gala) featuring electronic nocturnes and lulabyes. 
    Eat-this's production generally rests roughly in the territory of distribution-mate 
    Djak-up-bitch and is carving up the territory of IDM meets electro meets techno 
    meets ambient. All of the releases on this label have been worthy of required-listening 
    status, and have introduced some new names while maintaining ties with the 
    well-established contingent of local electronic acts. Noted contributions 
    have been made by Funckarma, L'usine, and Gimmik, with ties running through 
    Musik Aus Strom, Worm Interface, Clone, DUB, Isophlux and so on.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.eevolute.com" target="_blank">FWD</a> is a division of 
    Eevolute distributed by Clone releasing IDM and ambient techno. With a brief 
    catalog so far, Stefan Robbers has assembled some of the most elite artists, 
    having included .de's Arovane and .us's Acceleradeck alongside his own EPs 
    on the label.<br>
    <br>
    .de: <br>
    <a href="http://www.luxnigra.de/" target="_blank">Lux Nigra</a><br>
    Marching to its own drummer, Multipara's Lux Nigra label has managed to manufacture 
    with minimal fanfare a solid and unique catalog of incomperable releases. 
    Defying any standard description, these tend to range anywhere from hissing-sucking-breathing-grinding 
    noise (no movement, no sound, no memories) to anthemic hard-techno floorburners 
    (biochip c) to videogame soundtracks for 8-bit movies (Frederik Schikowski). 
    Unfortunately, this label has remained so enigmatic that it's been difficult 
    for the press, or likely even the fans, to pin down in any particular genre 
    or narrow interest-group. Quality and originality are the benchmark here and 
    'LN' continues to push forward in that regard, even while retrospectively 
    reissuing (HOPEFULLY) their long-unavailable initial release compilation, 
    this time to 'polycarbonatum.' <br>

    .us: <br>
    <a href="http://www.antennaintl.com/" target="_blank">Antenna</a><br>
    Antenna, created by Billy Dalessandro and Joshua Werner, is the home also 
    of Marko Katic. Think dark tech-electro. Only a pair of releases to date but 
    hints have been dropped that Yuppster and other local IDM purveyors may end 
    up turning this label towards the more cerebral side of electronic. Yet to 
    be seen...<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.someoddpilotrecords.com/" target="_blank">Someoddpilot</a>:<br>
    A design firm and recording label. These guys show their habitat by supporting 
    local acts who tend to wear their Chicago influence as a badge of honour. 
    Releases from this label tend to have creative edgy interior-design styled 
    art and are characterized either by the glitchy noise meets sparse industrial 
    of TRS-80 and Salvo Beta or the Tortoise / Thrill Jockey feel, though diverging 
    quite a bit from there with much of the rest of their roster. <br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.emphasisrecordings.com/" target="_blank">Emphasis</a>:<br>
    Another fledgling Chicago techno label. Steve Tang's creations are the more 
    melodic, swooning, futuristic, emotional and dynamic side of Detroit-influenced 
    techno and his production skill and taste has shown on the label's output 
    to date. Look forward to a resurgence by this artist and label in 2002.<br>
    <br>
    .au: <br>
    <a href="http://www.surgeryrecords.com.au/" target="_blank">Surgery</a><br>
    Tim Koch picks the music for this label. How could it possibly go wrong? Most 
    of these are worth the price of admission just for the cover art.<br>
    <br>
    Red Ember<br>
    First release featuring <a href="http://www.emphasisrecordings.com" target="_blank">Emphasis 
    Recordings</a>' Steve Tang. A good starting point.</font></SPAN> </div>
