  <!--this easily ranked as the worst gig of the year. from matthew dear getting picked 
  up by the promoter at the airport right next to us, to the cockroaches in the 
  bathroom, pretty much completely bad news. the venue ended up closing early 
  because not enough people showed up, we had people showing up asking where the 
  other show the promoter was putting on was, the promoter who I spoke with earlier 
  the same afternoon who said she'd be at the show never showed up, and then afterwards 
  most everyone from the show headed out to one of the competition's shows. the 
  next day I threw out my back something ferocious and was plagued by it for the 
  rest of the month. -->thanks to j_moody and florence for putting up scifisol, senor 
  frio and me. satamile was there and didn't even get to play because of when 
  we closed. thanks to the guy from southern outpost for coming through.</SPAN></DIV>
