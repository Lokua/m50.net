    <span class="playsmall">well, the good parts were: kone-r took good care of 
    me: had a nice place to sleep, shower, picked up kaz' crackers &amp; pita 
    (wrong pita I guess, but worth a try), guided me through the labyrinthine 
    tube system, and we all went out for a nice pizza dinner at a massive mall 
    near the venue. ginglik is great: hidden underground in plain view; entrance 
    through a traffic island; low ceiling; decently loud &amp; well-rounded sound, 
    expertly monitored by EK50 from Insekto, Semtek and Langer and Kone-R's friend 
    Justin all came through, as well as Stayhome's girlfriend and her brother 
    and his girlfriend, so we had a nice little corner going. the night was marred 
    by slight technical glitches: one channel of the record-output on the main 
    mixer was dead, Langer spilled beer on the mixing desk so that didn't help, 
    and when I started my set the Serato started acting up significantly, but 
    for the most part Kone-R and EK50 were on top of things.<br>
    the crowd, on the other hand, was a total fiasco. alternatingly beligerent 
    and petulant throughout the course of the night, early on I had a blonde guy 
    come up and tell me to &quot;play faster, no-one is dancing&quot; and then 
    gesture to the mostly-full dancefloor and moan woefully. later a drunk spanish 
    guy asking for shakira, and then trying to climb up the front of the stage 
    &amp; decks to explain to me that he really wanted me to play shakira, girls 
    asking if I have any r&amp;b, one girl actually coming up to ask &quot;do 
    you have any music you like&quot; at which point I got snappy and replied 
    that I'd come all the way from Chicago to play them shit music all night. 
    another girl just asked if I was going to be playing music &quot;like this&quot; 
    all night, and looked dejected at my reply, later a girl standing in the middle 
    of the dancefloor was demanding r&amp;b in 1 minute, 2 minutes? 3 minutes? 
    later pouting at me still from the same spot saying &quot;what's wrong with 
    you?&quot; even though there was a decent dancefloor most of the night, people 
    would insist on standing in front of the stage, sometimes even taking time 
    for SMSing there. towards the end of the night an indian girl came up, I turned 
    way down the mains to give her a proper audience, and undaunted she asked 
    if I had anything else, complaining that she was a captive listener, then 
    trying to be concilliatory asking that I might at least have prodigy, and 
    requesting to search through my records, looking shocked when I stopped her. 
    frustratingly, all of this hubub threw me off my game, so while the mixes 
    were fine, I don't feel like it was a particularly inspired show.<br>
    on the serindipitously bright side, kalli lent me his copy of round ireland 
    with a fridge, i started it on takeoff and read the last words on landing 
    back in berlin. it seemed fitting.</span></p>
