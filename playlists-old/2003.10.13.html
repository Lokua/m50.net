  </span> <SPAN CLASS="playsmall">Pretty amazing time, both of the guest sets 
  were very well executed: Common Factor's DJ set was a great mix of styles, and 
  Matt's PA was more downtempo and diverse than I'd heard from him before. Quite 
  a crowd braved the rain, which really started pouring down by the end of the 
  evening. In attendance: Thom Goerner, Derrick from La Makita Soma, Derrick Carter, 
  Colette, David Siska, Alicia Frantz, Jes, Atomly, Aaron Bennett, Brian, Karl 
  &quot;the fire&quot; Meier, Suprenova, DNSTodd, subK, Pat Sisson, all of String 
  Theory, Charlie from Telefon Tel Aviv, Quantazelle, Chris from Timeout Drawer, 
  John Curley, Sean from Parotic.<BR>
  <BR>
  Common Factor (DJ set) (Planet E, Soma, Tactile, SSR) <BR>
  Probably best known for his Pisces Groove EP and Dreams Of Elsewhere CD (both 
  on Planet E recordings),<BR>
  he's also gone on to create his own Tactile Recordings label <BR>
  and release for internationally acclaimed Soma and Paper recordings. <BR>
  He's put out two of of Mixmag's Singles of the Month<BR>
  with groovy tech-house sensations "Horizons" and "Get Down,"<BR>
  collaborated with celebrated house vocalist John Redmond <BR>
  and German deep techno producer Steve Bug, <BR>
  DJed regularly all over the world <BR>
  and been mentioned in Urb Magazine as one of the Top 100 artists to watch. <BR>
  This sought-after DJ, Producer, and Remixer has a deep, diverse record collection 
  <BR>
  (to put it mildly), <BR>
  impeccable taste well-rooted in musical history with an ear to the future, <BR>
  and will be sharing some of his favorite chill-out records and unheard of gems 
  <BR>
  in this unusual Chicago engagement. <BR>
  Be sure and arrive early to catch this one. <BR>
  <BR>
  Matt Mercer (live PA) (aka Systm - 409, Forte) <BR>
  This is a talented sound manipulator, <BR>
  facile at the task of decontextualizing <BR>
  and recontextualizing <BR>
  found sounds <BR>
  as the punctuation of his notably song-oriented arrangements. <BR>
  His notorious live sets are a combination of <BR>
  megamix-style bitwise alignments of his meticulous compositions <BR>
  and on-the-fly micromanaged plunderphonics. <BR>
  These performances tend to land him somewhere between <BR>
  the cut-n-paste mayhem of Akufen / Marc LeClair and <BR>
  the colourful minimalism of Anthony Rother electro. <BR>
  Matthew is both an accomplished visual and audio designer <BR>
  and a quickly ascending musician on the international tech-house DJ set, <BR>
  his tracks being recently played by the likes of Ptoile (Minimaldancin', Trenton 
  Records - Paris) <BR>
  and charted by Daniel Mnookin (Proton Radio, UR - Chicago) and <BR>
  Shalako (Redlight Productions - Boston). <BR>
  Again, an early performance this Monday evening.<BR>
  <BR>
  m50 (DJ set)<BR>
  Marking his debut evening as a resident host at Danny's, <BR>
  Maximum will be filling in the gaps here <BR>
  with intelligent and downright stupid cuts <BR>
  of lounge, hiphop, and tripped out ambient. <BR>
  He also broadcasts over the FM airwaves <BR>
  on Friday nights via WNUR <BR>
  and over the internet selected weeknights via Netmusique.<br>
  <br>
  2015 note: amazing how many people were at this show!!!</SPAN> </div>
