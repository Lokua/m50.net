Live soundscape and environmental sound improvisational collaborative performance 
& accompanying DJ sets this Monday@Danny's... <BR><BR>Vir Unis & James Johnson 
(collaborative live PA) (Atmoworks, Zero Music, Hypnos, Groove Unlimited) Join 
Danny's in welcoming an improvisational and interactive live performance between 
James Johnson, recording artist and proprietor of Atmoworks.com, and fractal ambient 
auteur Vir Unis<BR><BR> James Johnson formed his musical beginnings with the post-industrial 
outfit Illusion of Safety during the 1980s. Since those early days he's been carefully 
refining his own sound into a lush combination of purely synthetic layers coupled 
with a host of delicately processed organic instruments. With over 8 full length 
albums and nearly as many collaborative projects to his name, James continues 
to release stunning material on such labels as Hypnos, Windfarm Records, and his 
own Zero Music imprint. His latest Atmoworks album, Echoes, combines exotic generative 
middle eastern textures with enveloping ambient synthesis. <BR><BR>Meanwhile... 
Vir Unis, a master of shifting atmospherics in his own right, has concocted a 
unique flavour of pulsating 'fractal groove' rhythms and deep, meditative atmospheres. 
His unusual sound arrived on the ambient scene in 1999 with two initial ambient 
albums which were soon followed by the aptly titled solo full length 'Pulse n 
Atmo' for the Dutch label Groove Unlimited. Veteran producer and sound sculptor 
Steve Roach worked with him across three fantastic tribal chill-out albums, and 
the Vir Unis sound continued to evolve. Ranging from expansive futuristic electro 
to sublime 0-bpm soundworlds, his current sound eludes categorization. His latest 
effort, entitled Book of Mutations, is also available from Atmoworks. <BR><BR>Together 
this duo has performed in various art galleries, music festivals, and radio stations 
across the US and have released at least 7 CDs as a collaborative team. In addition, 
both artists have released multiple loop libraries for SonicFoundry, makers of 
the well-known Acid Loop software. Using their experiences of live performance 
these sound explorers will map out more of the great ambient unknown in realtime, 
coming together to create an exquisitely evolving soundscape. <BR><BR>http://www.virunis.com/ 
<BR><BR>http://www.atmoworks.com/ <BR><BR>Phonaut (DJ set) (Headtheater Radio, 
Mother-list recordings) A resident DJ on 89.3 FM for over 6 years and Sushi Wabi 
Tuesday resident, pHonaut's HeadTheater supplies WNUR with an eclectic wind-down 
period at the end of the week. His downtempo chill-out sets are made up of house, 
dub, electronic jazz, digifunk, downtempo, trance, drone, microglitch, drift, 
beatless textures, drummin' space, experimental, & abstract lounge. His touch 
on the turntables will certainly set the tone for this deeply melodic evening.
